 naval_equipment:0 "Ships"
 ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, the destroyers of the Great War must be repurposed and developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
 ship_hull_light_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."
 ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "The modern destroyer must be fitted with a variety of different detection technologies, new depth charge deployment systems and be built at a larger scale than their predecessors."
 light_cruiser_1:0 "Wooden Gunboat"
 light_cruiser_2:0 "Iron Gunboat"
 light_cruiser_3:0 "Steel Gunboat"
 light_cruiser_4:0 "Dwarven Gunboat"
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Maneuverable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Post-war treaties put restrictions on cruisers, but well-armed light vessels can be developed while remaining within these limits."
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Now skirting the limits of treaties, larger and more heavily armored cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Tactically employed to protect larger ships, the modern generation of light cruisers can shake off most past restrictions and be better armed to handle aerial attacks."
 heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Wooden Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Iron Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Steel Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Dwarven Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."
 ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Although bound by the stipulations of the Washington Naval Treaty, the cruiser is still the most flexible warship. This hull allows construction of a light cruiser for screening and scouting, or a heavy cruiser to support the battleline."
 ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The next generation of cruisers features new engine arrangements that improve survivability, as well as space for dedicated aircraft facilities."
 ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As cruisers around the world get more powerful and capable, new and larger hulls are needed to hold all the extra equipment needed."
 ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Influenced by wartime experiences, the latest generation of cruisers have a rearranged superstructure to allow wider fields of fire for anti-air armaments and new internal layouts to support the use of radar."

 battleship_3:0 "Steel Battleship"
 battleship_4:0 "Dwarven Battleship"
 battleship_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 battleship_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."
 ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."

 SH_battleship_1:0 "Steel Behemoth"
 SH_battleship_2:0 "Dwarven Behemoth"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."
 ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 ship_hull_cruiser:0 "Cruiser"
 ship_hull_cruiser_desc:0 "The workhorse of the fleet, cruisers take over a lot of important duties, from scouting and screening for light cruisers to supporting the battleline for heavy cruisers."

 ship_hull_heavy_desc:0 "The ultimate symbol of naval power, these massive, heavily armored behemoths still command respect on the high seas, even as some experts question their role in the age of the airplane and the submarine."
